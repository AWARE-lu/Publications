**Coder Dojo Luxembourg, a partnership with Hack4Kids and Microsoft Youthspark @eSkills for jobs**

On the 15th of december 2015, Hack4Kids (initiative developed by Securitymadein.lu) participated in partnership with [Coder Dojo Luxembourg](http://coderdojo.lu) at the [eSkills](http://eskills4jobs.lu/) conference that was held at the Parc Hotel Alvisse. The conference has the goal to encourage citizens to develop their digital skills to have an easier access to an ever digitizing work market. Hosted at the [Youthspark](https://www.microsoft.com/about/corporatecitizenship/en-us/youthspark/youthsparkhub/) booth (an initiative by Microsoft) we held a coding workshop for a handful of European youths present at the conference. Our group discovered the transition from a block based language like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) to a more real-life programming language such as [Python](https://python.org). The example used was a spiral drawing program where the user can chose the specification of the end-result. On our pop-up stand we also welcomed the interested delegates attending the conference who where themselves trying out what we teach in our weekly CoderDojo in Luxembourg City. All-in-all the youths, delegates and our mentors were pleased by the outcome and quiet a few attendees longed for more.
